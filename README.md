The goal of this project was to introduce myself to unit testing. In addition to make sure I didn't forgot the SOLID principles and other important design patterns. This game is heavily inspired by Isle of Arrows.

# Jam constraints

This project is a assignment in which I had to choose among several modifiers:
- "ULTRA VIOLENCE": Everything in the game must be about damaging or killing living things.
- "INDIRECT GAMEPLAY": The player creates the environment, the game play itself in that environment.
- "NO FUTURE": The game is all about staying on track as long as possible, but the player will lose in the end.

In the current version of the game, these modifiers apply as follows:
- ULTRA VIOLENCE: Enemies and strategic choices could make the player lose health.
- INDIRECT GAMEPLAY: Player place tiles which will automatically kills enemies. 
- NO FUTURE: The player can not gain health.

# Game manual

The player must defend the heart against never-ending waves of enemies. 
At start, the heart has 20 health points.

## Tiles

The player can improve their defense by placing new tiles. There are three types of tiles:

### Tower

The archer and ranger tower hurt enemies insight.

### Road

The straight and corner road extend the existing path by lengthening the path that the enemies must travel.

### Flag

The flag creates new grounds around itself.

## Enemies

Enemies spawns in waves going up the whole road to reach the heart. They all deal one damage to the heart. There are four types of enemies:

### Minion

The minion is the weakest enemy with only 2 health points.

### Mage

The Mage has 4 health points.

### Warrior

The Warrior has 8 health points.

### Rogue

The Rogue moves faster and has 16 health points. Good luck!

# How to play
